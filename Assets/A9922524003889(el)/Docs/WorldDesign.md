# World Building Brief – Low Poly Village Prototype

## Theme
The world represents a quiet, low-poly village set in an open outdoor environment. The theme focuses on simplicity, readability, and a calm atmosphere rather than detailed storytelling. The village feels lightly inhabited or recently abandoned, encouraging exploration while remaining easy to navigate.

## Layout
The layout is designed to support smooth player movement and spatial clarity:
- A mostly flat central area allows safe player spawning and testing
- Buildings are placed on stable ground and connected by visible paths
- Open spaces are intentionally preserved to avoid clutter
- Environmental elements such as trees and props are grouped logically rather than scattered randomly

The layout prioritizes traversal and scale testing over visual density.

## Environment Design
- Low-poly assets are used consistently to maintain a cohesive visual style
- Trees and natural props are clustered to simulate natural placement
- Structures are spaced to ensure walkable routes for the player
- All environment elements are implemented using prefabs to support reuse and easy iteration

Lighting and skybox are kept neutral and readable, ensuring the environment is clearly visible and testable with the existing Player Controller.

## Purpose
This world prototype is intended as an early environment setup to validate terrain scale, player movement, and logical prop placement. It serves as a foundation for future expansion rather than a final or fully detailed world.
